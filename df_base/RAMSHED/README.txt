Note re commit 9ee3d7b202a2b11177401b1d6d9cc85d7cee6a8d
I accidentally committed the entire revision in one go (instead of in 2 stages)
The revision contains:
- fixing position of light WAX in crate "puzzle" area (so it isn't hanging in mid air)
- anchored texture on seccrate.0
- textured the new backtracking elevator so it matches the other elevators
