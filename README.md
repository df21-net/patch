# patch
This is a repo to host a fan-made patch for Dark Forces

Please only commit changes that are fixes to existing structures. Do NOT dump the entire GOB file contents into the patch folders,  they will be removed. 

## Proceedures for committing changes

When deciding to work on a change, please follow these steps so that we can keep a referenced history of changes. For now, please use WDFUSE 2.10b3 for editing so files have consistent structuring.

- Check if the file you will be modifying is in the repo
  - If it is not, extract the file from the GOB and upload it to the repo without changes
  - Then open the file/map in WDFUSE and save the level (this will restructure the files)
  - Now upload the restructured files (before making any changes) to the repo
- If the file is in the repo, or you have now uploaded it, then check if there is an Issue for the problem you are going to address
  - If there is not, create the Issue and outline the problem
- When uploading your fix, please reference the Issue number and give a short description of what you did and what we should expect from your change
